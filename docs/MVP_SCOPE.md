# MVP Feature Set

## Must-Have (Internship-Ready)

| Feature | Why Must-Have |
|---------|---------------|
| **User Authentication** | Security baseline - can't have personal data without accounts |
| **Project CRUD** | Core functionality - create, read, update, delete projects |
| **Structured Project Form** | Name, description, tech stack, links, architecture, tradeoffs, challenges - the essential interview prep fields |
| **Code Snippets** | Key differentiator - syntax-highlighted code with explanations |
| **Search** | Find projects/snippets quickly before an interview |
| **Responsive Design** | Students review on phones before interviews |
| **Project Detail Page** | Single view for all interview prep material |
| **Basic Interview Questions** | Manual Q&A storage (not AI-generated yet) |

**Total: 8 features → ~2-3 weeks of focused development**

## Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP)

| Feature | Why Deferred |
|---------|--------------|
| **AI Question Generation** | Adds complexity; manual questions work for MVP |
| **AI Answer Evaluation** | Requires prompt engineering, testing, API costs |
| **Practice Session Tracking** | Nice analytics, but not essential to core value |
| **Dark Mode** | UX polish, not core functionality |
| **Data Export (JSON/PDF)** | Useful but not critical for launch |
| **Keyboard Shortcuts** | Power user feature |
| **Markdown in Notes** | Rich text adds complexity |
| **Tags/Categories** | Search covers this use case for now |

**Phase 2: Add AI features after MVP validation**

## Explicitly Excluded (Avoid Scope Creep)

| Feature | Why Excluded |
|---------|--------------|
| **GitHub Auto-Import** | Complex OAuth + parsing; manual entry is fine |
| **Team/Sharing Features** | Personal tool, not collaborative |
| **Voice Recording** | Transcription adds major complexity |
| **Mobile App** | Responsive web is sufficient |
| **Resume Builder** | Different product; stay focused |
| **Job Application Tracker** | Scope creep into different problem |
| **Video Tutorials** | Content creation, not software |
| **Public Portfolio Mode** | Changes privacy model significantly |
| **Spaced Repetition** | Algorithm complexity for marginal benefit |
| **Social Features** | Not the core problem being solved |
